# CitiBike Logger

I've deployed this on NodeJitsu. I'm logging data from CitiBike's [public station data](https://citibikenyc.com/stations/json) and storing it on [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com). I've yet to decide what to do with the data. I'm thinking of doing a visualization of some sort to show bike availability over the course of a day.
